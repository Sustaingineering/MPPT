This project contains code to run either the "Perturb and Observe" or "Incremental Conductance" algorithm on a
Ti Piccolo F2802x series microcontroller. See the comments in the code to gain an understanding of the program.

To run the code on the microcontroller you will need one of the following:

A. The MPPT prototype:
1) A C2000 LaunchPad development board with USB cable
2) The MPPT prototype board that the LaunchPad plugs into
3) The modified Chorizo board (microcontroller (U1) has been removed)
4) Wires connecting the prototype board and the chorizo (one set for power and one set for PWM)
5) Power supply and wires

B. The HedgeHog board
1) Fully populated Hedgehog board
2) Spectrum Digital XDS100v2 programmer
3) Power supply and wires
