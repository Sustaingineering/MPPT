This project contains code to run the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm on the Piccolo microcontroller.

More information on the particle swarm algorithm can be found at

To run the code on the microcontroller you will need one of the following:

A. The MPPT prototype:
1) A C2000 LaunchPad development board with USB cable
2) The MPPT prototype board that the LaunchPad plugs into
3) The modified Chorizo board (microcontroller (U1) has been removed)
4) Wires connecting the prototype board and the chorizo (one set for power and one set for PWM)
5) Power supply and wires

B. The HedgeHog board
1) Fully populated Hedgehog board
2) Spectrum Digital XDS100v2 programmer
3) Power supply and wires
